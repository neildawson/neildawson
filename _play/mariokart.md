# {{ page.short_description }}

If you want your Mario Kart tournament to be a success, everyone needs to know the controls.

I designed this diagram to be printed large as an easy reference for players, especially those unfamiliar with the Nintendo Switch JoyCon controller.

[Download the PDF](../assets/mariokart/Mario Kart 8 Controls.pdf) and print as big as you like â€“ it's vector!

I iterated to improve concision and clarity.

Key actions are most prominent and advanced techniques like defending are labelled underneath. The diagram doesn't *teach* the advanced concepts, instead serving as prompts and "knowledge in the world", as Don Norman would put it!
