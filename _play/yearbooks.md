What did you do in 2016? Probably a lot more than you remember. I set out to record my year, not just in photographs, but also in the books, games, shows, exhibitions, and other experiences I had.

Now the 2016 and 2017 books are printed, 2018 is in progress, and Iâ€™m using what I learned in a more ambitious project to create a coffee table book of my trip to Iran in 2013.
