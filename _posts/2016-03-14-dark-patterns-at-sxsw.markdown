Cristina and I presented our talk, [*Dark Times for Dark Patterns*](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP49272), at South by South West Interactive a few weeks ago.

>As designers, we sometimes find ourselves on a knife edge between user needs and business goals. It can be tempting to fall back to “dark patterns” – processes designed to trick users – because they are a shortcut to results. However, the use of dark patterns isn’t conducive to a good night’s sleep. Most of us want to find solutions that don’t resort to deceiving users. This talk will explore alternatives to infamous and common dark patterns, with a focus on how we can use psychological principles and persuasive design techniques to meet goals through encouragement rather than deception.
