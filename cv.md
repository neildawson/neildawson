I'm an experience designer with six years of industry experience. **I fight for the users**.

As a project leader and teammate I am respectful and empathetic. I'm known for my thoroughness and careful communication with colleagues and clients.

With a background in computing and knowledge of HTML, CSS, version control, and coding fundamentals, I work very closely with developers to plan, test, and launch products efficiently.

[Meetups and conferences](http://lanyrd.com/profile/neildawson/past/) (UX London, EuroIA, Beyond Tellerand, Smashing Conf…) inspire reflection and get me excited about trying new things, so I'd like an employer who can send me to these events - in return, [I'll happily write up what I learned and present it to the team](http://www.slideshare.net/neildawson/findings-from-ux-london).

I'm looking for a place with a different way of working, where I can get out of my comfort zone and learn new approaches to solving problems. I'm especially interested in teams where research and testing with real users is a regular part of every project.
