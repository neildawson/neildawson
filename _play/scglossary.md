# {{ page.short_description }}

Star Citizen is a multiplayer space simulation game on a grand scale, in development for PC.

I coded and wrote [a responsive glossary](../scglossary) to make sense of all the terminology, and to explore some CSS features I hadnâ€™t played with yet, like transforms, animations, and pseudo elements. Try visiting on a few devices to see how the page changes to suit device width.

Visually, the glossary uses aspects of [the game's website](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/), with navigation based on [Brad Frost's footer anchor concept](https://codepen.io/bradfrost/full/mlyvu).
