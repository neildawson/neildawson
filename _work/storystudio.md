In 2016, Sainsbury’s launched a stop-motion movie kit featuring the characters from their Christmas campaign. We designed a companion app for iOS and Android, letting kids turn the sets and characters into their own animated movies.

We carried out competitor analysis and user testing with kids, establishing a model different to any other: where other apps ask you make decisions before you start, like naming the film and choosing a title card, in Story Studio you get straight to making the movie. The app is literally centred around the movie, with the surrounding controls changing to suit the mode. Apply a filter, see it on the movie. Change the framerate, see the movie at that speed. This removed a layer of complexity.

When researching how to design for children, we wrote a list of principles to guide us. One of those said not to bore kids with up front lessons; let them make mistakes, and use those as teaching opportunities. We identified five such opportunities, each triggering a tip explaining what happened and how to fix it.

We know the “new movie” button was pressed 170,000 times on Christmas day!
